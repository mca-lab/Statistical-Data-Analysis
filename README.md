**Instructions for Students**

* Each student will submit their R lab solutions using their own branch.
Follow these steps carefully:

> 1. **Create a branch with your name**
>    Example:
>
>    ```bash
>    git checkout -b yourname
>    ```
>
> 2. **Add your R script (solution)**
>    Save your R file in the appropriate folder (e.g., `Week1_Desc_Stats/`).
>    Use a clear filename such as `yourname_DescStats.R`.
>
> 3. **Commit and push your changes**
>
>    ```bash
>    git add yourname_DescStats.R
>    git commit -m "Added Descriptive statistics solution - yourname"
>    git push origin yourname
>    ```
>
> 4. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**
>
>    * Go to the GitHub repository in your browser.
>    * Click **Compare & pull request**.
>    * Make sure the base branch is **main**, and your compare branch is **yourname**.
>    * Write a short description of your work.
>    * Submit the PR.
>
> 5. **Important rules:**
>
>    * Make changes **only in your own branch**.
>    * **Do NOT** edit or merge into the `main` branch.
>    * You can update your branch later by committing again and pushing.
>

>
> *Tip:* Always pull updates from `main` before starting a new lab to stay in sync.
>
> ```bash
> git checkout main
> git pull origin main
> ```
